## Reflection

    This is a personal project built during my second year at University of the Philippines Diliman. The goals for this project is to apply my knowledge on starting projects, such as common modules for enhancing development experience such as ESLint, Husky, and Prettier, as well as try maintain a project using Typescript. I also plan to showcase my skills on designing decent user interfaces with simple animations that enhances user experience. 

    This project is intended to act as a productivity app, specifically a pomodoro timer, which helps people focus on their work using the pomodoro technique. I envision this app to have a stats tracker also to let users keep track on how much time they are allotting on doing their work.

    I built this project using `vite`  with `react` as the front-end framework.
